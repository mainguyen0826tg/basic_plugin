 * Default implementation of the insight rendering customizer. Notice that the state of the customizations
 * is kept separate from this class.
 *
 * This code is responsible for creation of the providers (if needed) and then updating the state
 * accordingly. The customizer state methods are responsible for doing correct updates of the state itself. This
 * decoupling is in place so that it is possible to seal the state and prevent write operations from some point
 * onward. See {@link SealedInsightCustomizerState} for more motivation behind this.
