     *
     * ## Use
     *
     * ### Add filter parents
     *
     * To connect filter `A` to parent `B` and `C` you need to know display forms of all filters, also connecting attribute
     * of `A` with `B` and `A` with `C`. Create one `ISetFilterParentsItem` with filter display form `A` and two parent display forms
     * `B` and `C` with their common attributes shared with `A`.
     *
     * ### Remove filter parents
     *
     * If you want to remove connection between `A`, `B`, `C` just create `ISetFilterParentsItem` with `A` filter and empty array
     * `parents` property.
     *
     * ## Filter references
     *
     * All referenced filters need to be present on a dashboard. They are referenced by attribute display form. If filter or parent filter
     * is not found it will result in `FilterNotFound` error
     *
     * ## Circular dependency
     *
     * One filter can have multiple parents but filters can not depend on themselves, even over another filter. For example
     * case `A -> B -> A` will result in error `CircularDependency`
     *
     * ## Other invalid cases
     *
     * Referencing same filter multiple times in `filters` property is not allowed and will result in `DuplicateFilters`
     * error. Referencing same parent multiple times in single filter item is also not allowed and will result in
     * `DuplicateParents` error. If filter and its parent does not share connecting attribute it will result in
     * `IncompatibleConnectingAttribute` error.
