GoodData Number.js
==================

It is a *Flexible JS Formatting Library* based on the MIT licensed
https://code.google.com/p/flexible-js-formatting/ lib of Baron Schwartz.

It is collection of functions for formatting numbers using Excel-like formatting strings.

Usage
-----
```
var number = require('@gooddata/numberjs');

number.numberFormat(value, format, undefined, this.get('locale').separators);
number.colors2Object(number.numberFormat(value, format, undefined, this.locale.separators));
number.FormatTranslator.translate2default(newFormat, this.separators);
number.FormatTranslator.translate2custom(format, this.COMPONENT.locale.separators);
number.containsNullConditionalFormat(this._getMetricFormat());
```
Development
-----------

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (node 12.16.1, npm v6.13.4) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) 1.22.4.

To bootstrap the environment run the following the repository root:
```
$ yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

Tests are executed using:
```
$ yarn test
```

Versioning
----------

NPM package.json version number and RPM package version number are independent.
NPM package.json version should reflect changes in code and RPM package
version is supplied by build pipeline (gdcversion macro) to ensure smooth
integration in GDC build flow.

For bower repository the bower.json version string is to be adjusted to
always match the package.json.

```
$ ./build.sh
```
