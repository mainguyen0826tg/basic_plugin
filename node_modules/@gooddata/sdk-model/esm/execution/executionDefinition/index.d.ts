 *
 * -  If two execution definition have different fingerprint, they MAY OR MAY NOT lead to different execution. Or
 *    more concrete: two executions with two different fingerprints MAY lead to the same execution and same results.
 *
 * While not optimal, this contract allows for safe usage of fingerprints to determine whether two
