/**
 * This wrapper for {@link @gooddata/sdk-backend-spi#IDataView} provides various convenience methods to work with data and metadata stored inside
 * the provided instance of {@link @gooddata/sdk-backend-spi#IDataView}.
 *
 * The facade keeps an ephemeral state - such as calculated indexes on top of the headers in the {@link @gooddata/sdk-backend-spi#IDataView} -
 * to optimize performance of often-used lookups at the cost of extra memory.
 *
 * The facade is part of the public API and we strongly recommend to use it whenever client code needs to work with
 * data view; ideally, single instance of data view facade
 *
 * Note: the facade is currently in alpha quality - mix-match of various functions we found useful so far; consolidation
 * and further enhancements will happen, the methods will be removed, renamed and added in the future. The public
 * API WILL break.
